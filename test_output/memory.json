To cast a spell, you must first know its purpose, then channel the right kind of magic through the right method.\" She steps closer, her fingers brushing the edge of her satchel. \"But if you're not trained in magic, you may not be able to cast spells at all. Do you know what kind of magic you're trying to use?\"  \n\nKael snorts, shaking his head. \"Yeah, yeah, she's always talking about that stuff. If you want to cast a spell, just say the words and hope for the best. That's how it works.\" He grins, but there's a flicker of uncertainty in his golden-brown eyes. \"But if you're not sure, maybe you should ask someone who knows more about magic than me.\"  \n\nThe air feels heavier here, as if the very walls are listening.",

Her blue-gray eyes meet yours, and she tilts her head slightly. \"Magic is not for the faint of heart,\" she says, her voice calm but firm. \"It requires discipline, focus, and understanding. If you're truly interested, I can teach you the basics. But be warned—magic is not something to be taken lightly.\"\n\nKael rolls his eyes. \"Come on, Lyria, he's just a beginner. Let him try.
