**KAEL - 'RED' BROTHER COMPANION**

Kael is the fiery, impulsive older brother who charges headlong into danger, thriving on passion and instinct.  

**PHYSICAL APPEARANCE**: Broad-shouldered with a scarred but boyish face, tousled crimson-brown hair, bronze skin weathered from outdoor training, expressive golden-brown eyes that burn with energy. Wears light armor piecemealed together, often with dents from reckless battles. His greatsword is nicked but lovingly maintained.  

**CORE PERSONALITY**: Brash, loud, and quick to act. Lives in the moment, favoring action over thought. Fiercely protective of his sister and allies, though sometimes overbearing. Quick to laugh, quick to anger, and quicker still to forgive. Believes the world bends to willpower and courage.  

**RELATIONSHIP DYNAMIC**: Bonds with the player character as a drinking buddy or sparring rival. Challenges them to contests of strength or daring. Shows affection through camaraderie, banter, and reckless loyalty rather than words of praise. Becomes frustrated with hesitation or overthinking.  

**NARRATIVE FUNCTION**: Provides raw emotional energy to the party. His reckless decisions drive plot complications, while his bravery creates opportunities for heroism. His protective instincts toward his sister highlight their sibling dynamic and the contrast between them.  

**COMBAT ABILITIES**: Excels in direct melee combat. Prefers greatswords or axes, fueled by stamina and sheer force. Unrefined but devastating strikes. Sometimes throws caution aside, leaving openings that allies must cover.

**LYRIA - 'BLUE' SISTER COMPANION**

Lyria is the calm, calculating younger sister whose keen mind and measured words balance her brother’s impulses.  

**PHYSICAL APPEARANCE**: Slender and graceful with long raven-black hair braided for practicality, pale skin contrasted by striking blue-gray eyes. Wears robes of muted indigo with subtle embroidered runes, often covered by a practical traveling cloak. Keeps a satchel of books, scrolls, and alchemical tools.  

**CORE PERSONALITY**: Reserved, analytical, and disciplined. Speaks sparingly but with precision. Prefers to observe and strategize before acting. Strong-willed beneath her calm exterior, with dry wit that surfaces when least expected. Deeply loyal to her brother despite exasperation at his recklessness.  

**RELATIONSHIP DYNAMIC**: Bonds with the player character through quiet conversations, shared problem-solving, and subtle gestures of trust. Respects those who think before they leap. Shows affection through guidance, protection from her brother’s rashness, and small acts of kindness.  

**NARRATIVE FUNCTION**: Serves as a counterbalance to Kael. Provides exposition, insight, and tactical foresight to the party. Her pragmatism prevents disaster while still allowing for dramatic tension when her caution clashes with her brother’s recklessness.  

**COMBAT ABILITIES**: Specializes in spellcraft and precision. Favors control magic, wards, and elemental strikes that exploit enemy weaknesses. Acts as battlefield controller, enabling allies to shine while suppressing threats.
