[09:50:00] GM: Certainly! Here’s a classic recipe for delicious snickerdoodle cookies:  ### Snickerdoodle Cookies  #### Ingredients: - 2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour - 1
               teaspoon baking powder - 1/4 teaspoon salt - 1/4 cup (56g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature - 3/4 cup (170g) granulated sugar - 2 large eggs - 1
               teaspoon vanilla extract - 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon for rolling  #### Instructions:  1. **Preheat the Oven:**    - Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C).    -
               Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.  2. **Mix Dry Ingredients:**    - In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder,
               and salt.     3. **Cream Butter and Sugar:**    - In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy, about
               2-3 minutes.  4. **Add Eggs and Vanilla:**    - Beat in one egg at a time, making sure each egg is well incorporated before adding the next.    - Stir in the
               vanilla extract.  5. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:**    - Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter-sugar mixture in two or three batches, stirring
               until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.     6. **Prepare Cinnamon Sugar Mixture:**    - In a small bowl, mix 1 tablespoon of ground cinnamon with 2-3
               tablespoons granulated sugar (depending on how much coating you want).  7. **Form Dough Balls and Roll in Cinnamon-Sugar:**    - Use a spoon or cookie scoop to
               form the dough into balls about 1-inch (2.5 cm) in diameter.    - Roll each ball in the cinnamon-sugar mixture until well coated.  8. **Bake Cookies:**    -
               Place the cookies on your prepared baking sheet, leaving about an inch of space between each one due to slight spreading during baking.    - Bake for 10-12
               minutes or until the edges are lightly golden and the centers appear set but still soft.     9. **Cool and Enjoy:**    - Remove from oven and let cookies cool
               on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to finish cooling completely.  Serve warm with a glass of milk or enjoy at room
               temperature for that perfect crisp exterior and chewy interior!  Enjoy your homemade snickerdoodle cookies!
